BETA: This component is mostly stable but breaking changes could still be made outside of major version releases if a fundamental problem with the component is found.

Write messages to an Apache Pulsar server.

```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
output:
  pulsar:
    url: ""
    topic: ""
    max_in_flight: 1
```


## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for
improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages with the
field `max_in_flight`.

## Fields

### `url`

Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yaml
# Examples

url: pulsar://pulsar.us-west.example.com:6650

url: pulsar+ssl://pulsar.us-west.example.com:6651
```

### `topic`

A topic to publish to.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput.
